      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since moving to Neovim I&amp;rsquo;ve been printf() debugging. This approach is usually good enough for my side projects at home, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie, there are times when I miss step debugging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year I have been delving deeper into programming languages. In my journey so far I have created a few languages based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html&#34;&gt;Lox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://monkeylang.org&#34;&gt;Monkey&lt;/a&gt;. And I am now at a point where I want to create my first &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; toy language. A language for me to learn more concepts and try out different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I went on a longer trip in an EV, and wow it was painful. And traveling in temperatures between -15 and 0 degrees Celsius made it a tad more interesting than I wanted it to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last two years, I have taken a break from programming in C#. After eight years of programming in C# professionally, I felt it was time to explore something new and unknown to me. It is scary to do something outside of your comfort zone, but they tell me that is how you grow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
