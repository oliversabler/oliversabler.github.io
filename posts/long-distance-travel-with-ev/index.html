				<p>Recently, I went on a longer trip in an EV, and wow it was painful. And traveling in temperatures between -15 and 0 degrees Celsius made it a tad more interesting than I wanted it to be.</p>
<p>When charging, in the best of cases, I can plug the cable in the car, scan my credit card and let it charge for 20-30 minutes and then be on my way. I think that is an ok scenario. But the reality is that I usually need to queue for a spot at a 150+ kW station, enough time to cool the battery which makes the charging a little slower initially. Then I have to download an app, create an account, register my credit card, and hope the charger actually works. On this trip, that routine usually took between 1 and 3 hours which was very stressful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I can recommend traveling long distances in winter weather in an EV. But I am hopeful that future EVs will handle this better.</p>
